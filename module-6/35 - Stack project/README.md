# palindrome


The hie.yaml file is created after generating the project template.
hie.yaml is a configuration file for Haskell Language Server.
The gen-hie command outputs automatically generated settings to the console:

```yaml
cradle:
    cabal:
    - path: "src"
        component: "lib:palindrome"

    - path: "app/Main.hs"
        component: "palindrome:exe:palindrome-exe"

    - path: "test"
        component: "palindrome:test:palindrome-test"
```

However, it is also necessary to add the Setup.hs configuration to:

```yaml
cradle:
  multi:
    # Direct cradle for Setup.hs
    - path: "./Setup.hs"
      config:
        cradle:
          direct:
            arguments: []
    # Stack cradle for the main project
    - path: "./"
      config:
        <Generated by gen-hie>
        
```
